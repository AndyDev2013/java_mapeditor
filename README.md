# About 

A basic java map editor I created for a prototype of a game. It lets the user choose between floor and wall tiles and then exports the image of the wall and floor and the text file of a 2D array of all the wall and floor tiles.

# Installation Notes

This is a small java program. So to run it you need java installed
and have set up the enviroment variable.

* Compile it on the command line [Command Line tutorial](http://www.instructables.com/id/Programing-with-Java-using-Command-Prompt/)
* Use and IDE like eclipse [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/)
* Use a simplier IDE like TextPad [TextPad](https://www.textpad.com/)
